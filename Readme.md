# Retail E-Commerce Sales Analysis (2014–2017)

## Project Overview

This project analyzes four years of retail e-commerce sales data (2014–2017) to evaluate revenue drivers, profitability, customer behavior, seasonality, and regional performance.

The dataset contains:

* 9,994 orders
* 793 unique customers
* 1,862 products
* Total revenue of $2.29M 

The objective of this analysis is to identify operational inefficiencies and provide data-driven business recommendations.

## Revenue and Profitability Analysis

Revenue is distributed relatively evenly across three categories:

* Technology: 36% of total revenue
* Furniture: 32%
* Office Supplies: 31%

However, profitability reveals a major imbalance:

* Technology profit margin: 17.4%
* Office Supplies profit margin: 17.0%
* Furniture profit margin: 2.5%

Although Furniture generates nearly one-third of total revenue, it contributes very little to overall profit.

Business implication: The company is revenue-strong but profit-inefficient in the Furniture category.

Recommendation:

* Reassess discount strategies
* Optimize logistics and shipping costs
* Renegotiate supplier pricing
* Shift marketing focus toward higher-margin categories

## Seasonal Sales Trends

Monthly analysis shows strong seasonality:

* Revenue peaks in November and December
* January and February are the lowest-performing months

The business heavily depends on Q4 performance.

Business implication: Annual results are significantly influenced by year-end demand.

Recommendation:

* Increase marketing spend before Q4
* Improve inventory planning ahead of peak months
* Launch promotions during slow months to smooth revenue fluctuations

## Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis)

Customer segmentation reveals:

* 357 customers classified as “At Risk”
* Loyal customers generate the highest average lifetime value
* A significant portion of customers show declining engagement

Business implication: Customer churn represents a potential revenue risk.

Recommendation:

* Launch targeted reactivation campaigns
* Introduce loyalty and retention programs
* Personalize offers for high-frequency customers

Improving retention could significantly increase long-term profitability.

## Product and Regional Insights

Top-performing products are high-ticket items that generate substantial revenue despite low unit sales.

Business implication: Revenue is concentrated in premium products, creating dependency risk.

Recommendation:

* Protect inventory of high-value products
* Offer extended warranties and bundled services

Regional analysis shows:

* West and East contribute the highest revenue share
* South has relatively lower revenue but higher average order value

Recommendation:

* Expand marketing efforts in underperforming regions
* Explore regional demand patterns for targeted growth

## Key Conclusion

The company demonstrates strong revenue performance but faces profitability challenges, particularly in the Furniture category. Customer retention and margin optimization represent the largest opportunities for improvement.

By improving Furniture margins and implementing targeted retention strategies, overall profitability could increase substantially.
